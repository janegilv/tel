Description: manage telnet or ssh for routers/switches and other devices
 This handles the login and some other management features for many different
 types of switches and routers.  It tries to handle idiosyncrasies from the
 different vendors vty implementation (different backspace, local echo, etc)
 in a user extendable way.  Please see the README and website for more
 details.
