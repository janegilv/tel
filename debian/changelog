app-tel (0.2010_03) unstable; urgency=medium

  * pod2usage for -h help and summary if no arguments given
  * changed it so Term::ReadKey is loaded instead of used.  Term::ReadKey is
    an optional module loaded if you set the pagercmd to a special value.  It
    fakes an infinately long screen to try get output from a device with no
    "more" prompts.
  * applying chomp() to -x script input because we supply newlines when we
    send to the device.
  * adding -a to override autocmds via the cli when needed.

app-tel (0.2010) unstable; urgency=medium

  * lots of documentation updates
  * timing problems fixed by 0.2009 suppressing expect output in tests
  * added -d flag for turning debugging on to find problems
  * tel -l no longer implies "term len 0" (for compatibility with non-cisco
    devices)
  * changed hardcoded pager to use pagercmd.  It still defaults to Cisco but
    does the right thing if configured for juniper or dlink, etc.
